Retrocomputing is the use of older computer hardware and software in modern times.
Retrocomputing is usually classed as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of technology;
enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and software for sentimental reasons. However, some do make use of it.
The personal computer has been around since approximately 1976. But in that time, numerous technological revolutions have left
generations of obsolete computing equipment on the junk heap. Nevertheless, in that time, these otherwise useless computers
have spawned a sub-culture of vintage computer collectors, who often spend large sums to acquire the rarest of these items,
not only to display but restore to their fully functioning glory, including active software development and adaptation to modern
uses. This often includes so-called hackers who add-on, update and create hybrid composites from new and old computers for uses
for which they were otherwise never intended. Ethernet interfaces have been designed for many vintage 8-bit machines to allow limited
connectivity to the Internet; where users can access user groups, bulletin boards and databases of software. Most of this hobby centers
on those computers manufactured after 1960, though some collectors specialize in pre-1960 computers as well.`
